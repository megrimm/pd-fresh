#X text 24 47 This defines a data structure named "grob" \, which holds
a float called "number".;

#X text 73 24 Adding data to our data structure;
#X text 116 88 A data structure is \, the name hints at it \, a container
which carries data in a structured way.;
#X text 123 370 This "grob-03" struct now carries a float called number:
;
#X text 113 143 The data carried can be of the following four basic
types:;
#X text 147 172 1) floats;
#X text 148 194 2) symbols;
#X text 147 215 3) arrays containing several elements of one other
data structure type.;
#X text 147 254 4) lists containing elements of various other data
structure types.;
#X text 124 311 Arrays are like the "table" arrays in Pd \, which only
contain floats. Lists are like a subpatch which can contain objects
of various types.;
#X text 118 462 NB: Mathematically minded people like to call floats
and symbols "scalars" as well.;
