#X text 116 96 1) The "pd grob-02" subpatch here servers as a container
for a graphical object named "grob-02".;

the main patch \, but then it soon gets hard to group it with its own
drawing instructions. We'll come to these immediatly.;
#X text 117 151 2) To make it a real graph object \, it needs to contain
a "struct" definition. The "struct" object is used to give the name
\, by which to access a data structure.;
